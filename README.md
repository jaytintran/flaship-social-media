## Extra Infos

**React Context API**
- It is a part of the React library that provides a way to share values like properties (props) between components without explicitly 	passing them through the component tree via props. 
- It's particularly useful when dealing with state, theme, or any other data that needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
- The Context API consists of two main parts: the Provider and the Consumer.

**React Router**
- A popular library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. 
- It enables developers to create a single-page application (SPA) with dynamic, client-side routing. Instead of traditional server-side routing, where each page request involves a server round-trip, React Router allows the 	navigation to occur on the client side, updating the UI without a full page reload.

**React Query**
- A backend agnostic data fetching library with auto-caching, refetching, parallel queries, first-class mutations, loading & state management.
- It's a library for managing and caching server state in React applications. It is designed to simplify the process of handling data fetching, caching, and state management in a declarative and efficient way. 
- React Query is commonly used with React applications that interact with APIs to fetch and manipulate data.
